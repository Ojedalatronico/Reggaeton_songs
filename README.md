The main objective is to be able to write a reggaeton song based on first words parameters that we want in our reggaeton lyrics to contain with natural language processing with recurrent neural networks.

And a really important fact, you can do it with a telegram bot!  https://t.me/JBalvin_Writer_bot

## Steps (What we do)

### Web scrapping
We got the data from +20 reggaeton singers and their songs, in this way we trained our neural network.
(the website to perform web scrapping is Letras.com)

### Pre-processing the Dataset and preparing the dataset 
It was necessary to carry out a cleaning process of this data. We have worked with this data and we prepared for the next activities like shuffle and prepard the train size
We have to use natural language processing with recurrent neural networks

### Building the Model
I decided to use keras, the algorithm used was "adam" and we used a total of 10 epochs.

### Testing the Model
Later we had to test the model.

### Create telegram bot
We want that you use this in a easy way, so write a bot to you, so, you can write like your favorite reggaeton singer.
And, surprise, also sings.

#### Do you want to test yourself?
Go to telegram and use our bot.

## Why I do this project

I believe that projects are moments to do things that we are not comfortable with, that take us out of our comfort zone. This is a strange project for me, but very fun. Having fun is also an important part of learning

## What was the big challenge?

If you want to train a model like this you really need time, a good computer or think about the data out the box. You can't did this in 5 minutes, prepare yourseft!
