# bdmlpt1021 Project

#### Do you want write like J.Balvin write his songs? This project is for you

The main objective is to be able to write a reggaeton song based on first works parameters that we want our reggaeton lyrics to contain. (Maybe Telegram bot)

## Steps (What we do)

### Web scrapping
We got the data from +20 reggaeton singers and their songs, in this way we trained our neural network.
(the website to perform web scrapping is Letras.com)

### Pre-processing the Dataset and preparing the dataset 
It was necessary to carry out a cleaning process of this data. We have worked with this data and we prepared for the next activities like shuffle and prepard the train size
We have to use natural language processing with recurrent neural networks

### Building the Model
I decided to use keras, the algorithm used was "adam" and we used a total of 3 epochs (Maybe more in 2 days).

### Testing the Model
Later we had to test the model.

## Steps (What we do)

### Web scrapping
We got the data for our project by webscraping the existing reggaeton songs, in this way we trained our neural network.
(the website to perform web scrapping is Letras.com)

### Preprocesing 
It is necessary to carry out a cleaning process of this data. Even asking ourselves if the best way is to have it in a single string or to separate it by verses. It is also important to ask us if an English translation would be ideal for its correct operation.

### Training
-> DL models

Look at these photes


#### Do you want to test yourself?
Go to telegram and use our bot.

## Why I do this project

I believe that projects are moments to do things that we are not comfortable with, that take us out of our comfort zone. This is a strange project for me, but very fun. Having fun is also an important part of learning
