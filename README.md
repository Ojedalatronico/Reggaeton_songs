## Steps (What we do)

### Web scrapping
We got the data from +20 reggaeton singers and their songs, in this way we trained our neural network.
(the website to perform web scrapping is Letras.com)

### Pre-processing the Dataset and preparing the dataset 
It was necessary to carry out a cleaning process of this data. We have worked with this data and we prepared for the next activities like shuffle and prepard the train size
We have to use natural language processing with recurrent neural networks

### Building the Model
I decided to use keras, the algorithm used was "adam" and we used a total of 3 epochs (Maybe more in 2 days).

### Testing the Model
Later we had to test the model.

Look at these photes


#### Do you want to test yourself?
Go to telegram and use our bot.

## Why I do this project

I believe that projects are moments to do things that we are not comfortable with, that take us out of our comfort zone. This is a strange project for me, but very fun. Having fun is also an important part of learning
