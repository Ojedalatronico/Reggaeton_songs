# bdmlpt1021 Project

The main objective is to be able to write a reggaeton song based on certain parameters such as words that we want our reggaeton lyrics to contain. (Maybe Telegram bot)

## Steps (What we do)

### Web scrapping
We got the data for our project by webscraping the existing reggaeton songs, in this way we trained our neural network.
(the website to perform web scrapping is Letras.com)

### Preprocesing 
It is necessary to carry out a cleaning process of this data. Even asking ourselves if the best way is to have it in a single string or to separate it by verses. It is also important to ask us if an English translation would be ideal for its correct operation.
We have to use natural language processing with recurrent neural networks


### Training
-> DL models

## Dataset

This dataset is made by webscraping to www.letras.com
